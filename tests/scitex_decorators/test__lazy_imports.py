"""Regression tests for the joblib eager-import leak (todo#442).

The bug: pre-fix, ``import scitex_decorators`` (and the transitive
``import scitex.io`` chain) raised ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module
named 'joblib'`` whenever joblib wasn't installed in the venv, because
``_cache_disk.py`` and ``_cache_disk_async.py`` had top-level
``from joblib import Memory as _Memory``.

The fix: joblib is lazy-imported inside ``cache_disk()`` /
``cache_disk_async()`` function bodies only. ``import scitex_decorators``
must succeed without joblib; only constructing the decorator (= calling
it on a target function) requires joblib.

Same class of bug as #441 (flask), #279 (bs4), #443 (matplotlib).

This test file is intentionally separate from ``test__cache_disk.py``
because the latter eager-imports ``joblib.Memory`` for legacy tests and
gets skipped wholesale on no-joblib venvs — defeating the regression
guard. The tests below run unconditionally and only inspect module
source for the offending top-level import lines.
